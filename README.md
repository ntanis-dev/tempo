## About

**Tempo** is a workout timer I created to help structure my exercise routines. What started as a simple timing tool evolved into a comprehensive fitness companion built with modern web technologies.

- **Motivational Quotes** - Context-aware inspiration during each phase.
- **Workout Statistics** - Track your progress and performance.
- **Audio Feedback** - Sound cues for phase transitions.
- **Progressive Web App** - Install on any device, works offline.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds** - Animated themes for each workout phase.

## How It Works

1. **Setup** - Configure your workout parameters.
2. **Stretch** - Warm up with guided timing.
3. **Exercise** - Maintain perfect rep timing.
4. **Rest** - Recover between sets.
5. **Complete** - View statistics and achievements.
